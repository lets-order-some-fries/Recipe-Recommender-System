## Recipe Recommendation System

This project demonstrates a recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes based on given inputs. The system processes and cleans recipe data and uses various natural language processing techniques to extract relevant features from the recipe titles, ingredients, and instructions.

### Key Features:

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: 
  - **Text Cleaning**: Removes unwanted characters, punctuations, and stop words from the recipe text data to facilitate better analysis.
  - **Normalization**: Converts text to a uniform format, such as lowercasing and stemming/lemmatization, to ensure consistency.

- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - **Tokenization**: Splits the text into individual words or tokens.
  - **Vectorization**: Converts tokens into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for analysis.
  - **Ingredient and Instruction Processing**: Cleans and processes ingredient lists and cooking instructions to extract meaningful features.

- **Recommendation Algorithm**: 
  - **Similarity Metrics**: Uses cosine similarity or other distance metrics to find recipes that are most similar to the input recipe or user preferences.
  - **Recipe Ranking**: Ranks the recommended recipes based on their similarity scores.

- **Performance Evaluation**: 
  - **Precision and Recall**: Measures the accuracy and completeness of the recommendation system using precision and recall metrics to evaluate its performance.

### Notable Functions:

- **`clean_text(text)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Cleans and preprocesses the input text by removing unwanted characters, punctuations, and stop words.
  - **Parameters**: `text` (str): The text to be cleaned.
  - **Returns**: Cleaned and normalized text.

- **`vectorize_text(corpus)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Converts a collection of text documents into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or other vectorization techniques.
  - **Parameters**: `corpus` (list of str): The list of text documents to be vectorized.
  - **Returns**: A matrix of TF-IDF features.

- **`calculate_similarity(matrix)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Calculates the similarity scores between text documents in the vectorized matrix.
  - **Parameters**: `matrix` (numpy array or similar): The matrix of text features.
  - **Returns**: A matrix of similarity scores.

- **`recommend_recipes(input_recipe, top_n=10)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Recommends the top N most similar recipes based on the input recipe.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `input_recipe` (str): The input recipe for which recommendations are needed.
    - `top_n` (int): The number of top similar recipes to recommend.
  - **Returns**: A list of recommended recipes.

- **`calculate_precision_recall(recommended_recipes, relevant_recipes)`**:
  - **Purpose**: Calculates the precision and recall metrics to evaluate the recommendation system.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `recommended_recipes` (list of str): The list of recipes recommended by the system.
    - `relevant_recipes` (list of str): The list of known relevant recipes.
  - **Returns**: Precision and recall values.
